## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
![alt text](./hc_banner.jpg)
Hi, I'm Maciej, guy behind [StraightenUp](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/straightenup-ai-ai-postur/nfhoegpkonllcaghgmhdmcpmebmocokf). I work with Javascript and Python. Feel free to search around my repositories! 
I think most important branches of informatics are ML, cybersecurity and brain-computer interfaces.

My most recent on classification IT Technician questions into categories: [NLP project](https://github.com/PLtier/small-ds-projects/tree/main/NLP%20Exploration) and
[Other DS projects](https://github.com/PLtier/small-ds-projects)

PS.
Currently I'm looking for a student job within IT
